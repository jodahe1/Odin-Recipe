        Doro Wat (also spelled Doro Wot ) is a rich, spicy chicken stew that is considered Ethiopia's national dish. It is a slow-cooked masterpiece made with tender chicken pieces simmered in a deeply flavorful sauce of caramelized onions, garlic, ginger, and the signature spice blend berbere . Hard-boiled eggs are often added to absorb the aromatic sauce, making this dish both hearty and indulgent.
