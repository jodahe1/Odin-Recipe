        <p>Injera is a traditional Ethiopian flatbread that serves as both a staple food and a utensil in Ethiopian dining. It is made from teff flour, a tiny, nutrient-rich grain native to Ethiopia, though sometimes wheat, barley, or a blend of flours may be used. Injera has a unique sourdough-like flavor and a spongy, slightly chewy texture. Its surface is covered with tiny holes, which are created during the cooking process and help absorb the flavorful stews and sauces it accompanies.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            2 cups teff flour (or a mix of teff and all-purpose flour if teff is unavailable)
        </li>
        <li>
            4 cups water
        </li>
        <li>
            Salt to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            Vegetable oil for cooking
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mix the teff flour with water in a large bowl until it forms a thin batter (similar to pancake batter). Cover and let it ferment at room temperature for 2–3 days (or up to 5 days for a stronger sour flavor).
        </li>
        <li>
            Once fermented, stir in salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat and lightly grease it with oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour a ladleful of the batter onto the skillet and quickly spread it in a circular motion to form a thin layer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook until holes appear on the surface and the edges start to lift, about 2–3 minutes. Do not flip; injera is only cooked on one side.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove and repeat with the remaining batter. Stack the injera as you cook
        </li>
    </ol>
